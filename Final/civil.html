                            The current system consists of the program coordinator sending emails to eligible students with a form attached. The students send the filled form and references back to the program coordinator. The program coordinator then checks the files and creates a consolidated excel sheet of the responses. All the forms and references are consolidated in Excel and uploaded to Box. The committee members then sit together and decide who should receive the four types of awards.
                            The students have to contact the program coordinator via email in case of any questions. Information about the application process is not available on the Clemson website.

                             With the help of the guidelines by Ulrich and Eppinger, 48 need statements were formulated, which were the target specifications of the system.

                            Personas were created for our three stakeholders to understand the user's frustrations, behavior patterns, and demographics. Next, the team generated a set of 50 concepts, and a round of iteration was conducted upon them. After the second round, concept selection was carried out using two techniques: concept screening and scoring. 
                            Finally, a prototype was created using the selected concept once the concept was selected.

                            The first part of this phase was to create a detailed step-by-step task analysis model, which ensured that the prototype was in sync with the steps that needed to be performed by stakeholders.
                            The task analysis model helped us find inconsistencies between the designed prototype and the stakeholder's actual process. Our team encountered that we needed to create a placeholder for the scoring rubric for the committee members. Hence that was incorporated at this step. <br>
                            <br>
                            Next, the team conducted individual heuristic evaluations using Jacob Nielson's 10 usability heuristics. A rating was given for each and then discussed. 
                            The second round of changes led to a robust and reliable system. With Nielson's "Error Prevention" guideline, we incorporated a "Are you sure button?" to prevent users from making a mistake.

                            After completing the final prototype design, we conducted user testing to understand user experience, usability, and performance workload. 
                            The team selected three user testing objectives

                            <b>Objective three:</b>Understand user mental workload while interacting with the application portal<br>
                            <br>
                            First, we conducted Think aloud testing and semi-structured interviews with the stakeholders. <br>

                            The PSSUQ scale consists of 19 questions. The questions are categorized into three sections: System usability, information quality, and interface quality.
                            Each question is scaled from 1 = Strongly agree to 7  = Strongly disagree.The usability test scores were lower (strongly agree) for every system parameter. 
                            However, the participants had suggestions like having error messages, and some organizational information of the portal was unclear. After evaluating the results and completing our final design prototype, we made the necessary changes to our prototype.<br>

                            To understand the workload experienced by the participants, we next measured the participants' workload on NASA-TLX.
                            Our prototype has lower mental demands (M = 5.87) and efforts (M = 4.53) as well as temporal demand (M = 5.20). However, we have a little higher frustration score (M = 7.20).

                            <br>
                            Based upon the user interviews and PSSUQ findings, it was found that due to our system giving no error messages, the users felt a little frustrated while conducting some of their tasks. We addressed the same in our final prototype. 
                            Participants make mention of better individual performance interacting with the system. This was another issue highlighted by our committee members. The overall system seemed to have too many steps, but that was because of the system's complexity.
