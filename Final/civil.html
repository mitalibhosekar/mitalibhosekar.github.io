                            checked the application for eligibilities, inconsistencies; and the commitee members decided on the awards recipient.

                            The current system consists of the program co-ordinator sending emails to eligible students with a form attached. The students are supposed to send the filled form and references back to the program co-ordinator. 
                            The program co-ordinator then checks the files and created a consolidated excel sheet of the responses. All the forms, references and consolidated excel is uploaded on box.
                            The commitee members then sit togther and decide who should be awarded. There are four types of awards to be awarded.

                            In case of any questions the students have to contact the program co-ordinator via email. No information is displayed on the clemson website.

                        <p class="lead"> 
                            After the first round of semi-structered interviews we collected inofrmation about the process of the application. The stakeholders also conveyed thier frustartions, suggestions and problems they had faced. 
                            With the help of the guidelines by Ulrich and Eppinger 48 need statements were formutaled which were the target specifications of the system.
                            Below is a sample snippet of the needs list and box uploads.

                        <p class="lead">Once the needs were identified, an Affinity mapping was conducted to categorize the needs. Hence a list of primary and secondary list was formulated.
                            A survey was sent out to understand the relative importance of those needs amongst the stakeholders.
                            
                            Next, all the needs were categorized as subjective, objective or binary and metrics was associated with it to understand how those needs will be met. 
                            Competitve benchmarking was conducted of the Carat@Harvard System and Texas A&M system by researching on the innternet and interviewing students. 
                            Lastly, ideal and marginal values for were set in comparison with the competitors for the target system.

                            Persona's were created for our 3 types of stake holders, to understand the users frustrations, behaviour patterns, and demographics.

                            Next, a set of 50 concepts where generated by the team and a round of iteration was conducted upon them. After the second round, concept selection was carried out by using two techiques: namely concept screening and scoring.
                            
                            Finally, Once the concept was selected a prototype was created using the selected concept.

                        <p>
                            The first part of this phase was to create a detailed step by step task analysis model. This ensured that the prototype was in sync with the steps that needed to be performed by stakeholders.
                            This helped us find inconsistencies between the designed prototype and the stakeholders actual process. Our team encountered that we needed to create a placeholder stor the scoring rubric to be reviewed by the committee members. Hence that was incorporated at this step. <br>
                            <br>
                            Next the team consucted individual hueristic evaluation using Jacob Nielson's 10 usability heuristics. A rating was given for each and then discussed. 
                            A second round of changes were incorporated for a further robust and reliable system. With Nielson's "Error Prevention" guideline we incorporated a "Are you sure button?" to prevent users from making a mistake.

                        <p>
                            After completing the final prototype design, we conducted user testing to understand user experience, usability, and performance workload. 
                            The team selected three user testing objectives
                            <br>

                            <b>Objective one:</b> Understand user perspective of application portal and user interface <br>
                            <b>Objective two:</b>Understand award application system usability <br>
                            <b>Objective three:</b>Understand user mental workload while interacting with the application portal<br>
                            <br>
                            First, We conducted Think aloud testing followed by semi-structered interviews. Stakeholders were provided with a prototype link, and they spoke about the actions as they interacted witht he system.
                            After the tesing few questions were aksed about the system to tak the users opinion.<br>
                            <br>
                            Post the interview, the team sent them survey links to NASA-TLX (Task Load Index)  and Post Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ).These surveys were intended to gauge user workload experienced and the perceived usability of the award selection portal, respectively.<br>

                        <h4> Results</h4>
                        <p> 
                            The PSSUQ scale consists of 19 questions. The questions are categorized into three sections: System usability, information quality, and interface quality.
                            Each question is scaled from 1 = Strongly agree to 7 = Strongly disagree.The usability test scores were lower (strongly agree) for every system parameter. 
                            However, the participants had suggestions like having error messages, and some organizational information of the portal was unclear. After evaluating the results and completing our final design prototype, we made the necessary changes to our prototype.<br>
                            
                            <br>
                            To understand the workload experienced by the participants, we next measured the participants' workload on NASA-TLX.
                            Our prototype has lower mental demands (M = 5.87) and efforts (M = 4.53) as well as temporal demand (M = 5.20). However, we have a little higher frustration score (M = 7.20).

                            <br>
                            Based upon the user interviews and PSSUQ findings, it was found that due to our system giving no error messages, the users felt a little frustrated while conducting some of their tasks. We addressed the same in our final prototype. 
                            Participants make mention of better individual performance interacting with the system. This was another issue highlighted by our committee members. The overall system seemed to have too many steps, but that was because of the system's complexity.

                            David who is a student at clemson university, conveyed that he would want to see more information about the awards other than the email he recieved. Therefore, we started with an awards page added to the Civil Engineering department website.
                            This page will have information about the different awards, due dates with the application window, an FAQ section, and a link to the application system.<br>

                            The application system will automatically connect with Clemson iRoar (University Database) because both David and Lena (Program coordinator Persona) mentioned that there was information that they felt could have been pulled into the application for them. 
                            For David, this was his GPA and course information. For Lena, the students' coursework information had to be manually checked to verify their status within the department. With the application tied into Clemson iRoar, this information will automatically populate into the one portal for awards. <br>

                            <br>
                            The system will also automatically combine all students' responses into a single excel sheet that committee members will have direct access to from their system page, eliminating the step where Lena had to do this manually. From the excel sheet, Lena can easily filter students by their coursework and verify only qualified students to be included in the committee's evaluation. <br>

                            For Dr. Cha, we made two sets of improvements. First, she expressed a desire for a more standardized process of evaluating the subjective question responses. To help with this, we are providing a scoring rubric she can use as a guide. This rubric can be easily accessed from the application home page of the committee members. 
                            Additionally, we have added a formula to the excel form that weighs the different scoring factors like GPA, extracurricular involvement, and subjective responses. This formula will calculate a final score for each student allowing Dr. Cha and her colleagues to filter down to the top candidates for each award.
